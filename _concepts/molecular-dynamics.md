  Model atoms as points or spheres with positions, velocities, and forces.
  Define interactions using a force field (a mathematical model for bonds, angles, electrostatics, van der Waals forces, etc.).
  Integrate motion in small time steps (often ~1 femtosecond)
  Track trajectories to study properties like structure, energy, diffusion, and dynamics.
